# Find the Hideout

The dastardly villain has hidden, but we can find him.

Use the training dataset to create a classifier and find his location in the test dataset.

* `train_data.csv`: Training data with feature variables 0-7 and corresponding target variable values `y`.
* `test_x_data.csv`: New data with feature variables only.
